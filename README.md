# new-project
Ongoing new project



Content
1.  iris.csv - dataset containing iris data
2.  noteboook.ipynb - file containing Jupyter notebook
3.  charts - folder containing various charts


Update:  Have decided to do classification using iris dataset

# Objective
Accurately classify flower species according to properties found in the dataset.  Additionally, the project will explore different classifiers to analyze which ones perform better with the dataset.

# The Data
The data being used for this project is quite simple and includes a few measurements for each plant as well as the species.  The measurements used are sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, all in centimeters.  There are three species present in the dataset.

# Outline of project plan:
1.  Explore and clean the data
2.  Decide on a classifier 
3.  Implement the classifier
4.  Test the results
5.  Create charts that are helpful in examining the data/results
5.  Summarize findings, write a readme file containing results

Types of algos to use 
1. decision tree
2. random forest
3. k-NN
4. Naive Bayes


Evaluation methods
1. Precision and recall %  - this should be shown with a decision matrix
2. ROC curve
